# Clinical Topic Review Template

Template for comprehensive topic reviews. Derived from LITFL Critical Care Compendium and EM Cases podcast summary formats.

## Structure

```markdown
# [Topic]: [Subtitle - actionable angle]

**Written by [Author]; Edited by [Editor]**
**Expert Peer Review by [Reviewer, Credentials]**
**Last updated: [Date] | Review scheduled: [Date]**

## Key Points

> **Bottom Line:** [1-2 sentence summary of most important takeaway]

- [Key point 1 - actionable]
- [Key point 2 - actionable]
- [Key point 3 - actionable]

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs setting context: Why this matters, scope of the post, what reader will learn]

## [Section 1: Recognition/Assessment]

### [Subsection as needed]

[Content with evidence integration]

**Key threshold:** [Important number/cutoff with citation]

[CLINICAL PEARL NEEDED: Recognition pitfall or tip]

## [Section 2: Management/Approach]

### Initial Management

[First-line approach]

| Intervention | Dose/Parameters | Evidence | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| [Drug/Action] | [Specifics] | [Citation] | [Practical tip] |

### [Subsequent Management Sections]

[Continue pattern]

## Controversies and Evolving Evidence

[Explicitly address areas of uncertainty]

- **[Controversy 1]**: [Current state of evidence]
- **[Controversy 2]**: [Current state of evidence]

## Regional/Institutional Variation

[REGIONAL VARIATION: How does local practice differ from guidelines?]

## Special Populations

[Considerations for: pediatric, geriatric, pregnant, resource-limited settings]

## Summary Algorithm

[If applicable - decision tree or stepwise approach]

## References

[Numbered list with PMIDs/links]

## FOAMed Resources

- [Cross-references to related content]
```

## Content Standards

**Length:** 3,000-5,000 words typical; longer acceptable for complex topics with modular structure

**Evidence integration:**
- Inline citations for all factual claims
- Distinguish RCT evidence from observational/expert opinion
- Include specific numbers: NNT, ARR, confidence intervals
- Name landmark trials by acronym (readers know them)

**Tables for:**
- Drug dosing
- Differential diagnosis
- Comparison of approaches
- Diagnostic criteria

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Bold for critical thresholds and warnings
- Blockquotes for key takeaways
- Headers that describe content (not "Introduction" but "When to Suspect X")

## Uncertainty Language

Use explicit uncertainty markers:

| Evidence Level | Language |
|---------------|----------|
| Strong RCT evidence | "Evidence supports...", "Trials demonstrate..." |
| Observational only | "Observational data suggest...", "Based on cohort studies..." |
| Expert opinion/physiology | "Traditionally...", "Physiologically...", "Expert consensus suggests..." |
| Evolving/conflicting | "Evidence is conflicting...", "Awaiting results of [trial]..." |
| Unknown | "No evidence exists...", "This remains unknown..." |
