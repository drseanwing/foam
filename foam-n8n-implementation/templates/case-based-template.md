## Key Features

**Progressive revelation**: Case unfolds through 3-5 decision points. Each section adds clinical data.

**Clinical questions as headers**: Frame each section around the question the clinician faces, not the topic.

**Expert quotes**: Include blockquoted opinions from named clinicians, attributed with credentials.

**Clinical pearls**: Visually distinct (bold or blockquote), practical, memorable. Mark placeholders: `[CLINICAL PEARL NEEDED: topic]`

**Expert peer review**: Must include attributed peer review statement at top.

## Tone Calibration

- Write as experienced colleague, not lecturer
- First person acceptable for clinical reasoning ("I would consider...")
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly
- Reference shared clinical knowledge without over-explaining basics
