# [TRIAL ACRONYM] — [Descriptive Title]

*REdI — Resuscitation EDucation Initiative | Metro North Health*

**[Author]. [Journal] [Year]. doi:[DOI]**

## Clinical Question

In [population], does [intervention] compared with [comparator] [improve/reduce] [outcome]?

## Background

- [Context point 1 - why this matters]
- [Current standard of care]
- [Evidence gap this trial addresses]
- [Physiological rationale if relevant]

## Design

- [Study type]: Multicentre, [blinding], randomised controlled trial
- Randomisation: [method, ratio, stratification]
- [Blinding details]
- Analysis: [ITT, per-protocol, etc.]
- Sample size: [N] needed to detect [effect size] with [power]% power

## Setting

- [Number] sites in [countries]
- [Recruitment dates]
- [Setting details: ED, ICU, ward, etc.]

## Population

**Inclusion:**
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

**Exclusion:**
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

[Screening â†’ Randomisation flow: X screened â†’ Y randomised â†’ Z analysed]

**Baseline characteristics** (intervention vs control):
- [Key characteristic]: X% vs Y%
- [Key characteristic]: X vs Y

## Intervention

[Description of intervention protocol]
- [Key parameter 1]
- [Key parameter 2]
- [Actual delivered: what patients received in practice]

## Control

[Description of control protocol]
- [Key parameter 1]
- [Key parameter 2]

## Management common to both groups

- [Co-intervention 1]
- [Co-intervention 2]

## Outcomes

**Primary outcome:** [Outcome definition]
- Intervention: X/N (X%)
- Control: X/N (X%)
- [Effect measure] (95% CI X to Y), p = X
- NNT/NNH = X (if applicable)

**Secondary outcomes:**
- [Outcome 1]: X% vs Y%, [effect measure] (95% CI)
- [Outcome 2]: X% vs Y%, [effect measure] (95% CI)

**Subgroup analyses:**
- [Pre-specified subgroups and findings]

## Authors' Conclusions

"[Direct quote from paper's conclusion]"

## Strengths

- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
- [Strength 3]

## Weaknesses

- [Weakness 1 - methodological]
- [Weakness 2 - generalizability]
- [Weakness 3 - clinical relevance]
- [Consider: blinding, power, surrogate outcomes, external validity]

## The Bottom Line

[2-4 sentences: What this means for practice. Be explicit about:
- Whether this changes practice
- Remaining uncertainties
- Who this applies to]

## External Links

## Critical Appraisal Checklist

When drafting, systematically address:

â–¡ Was allocation concealed?
â–¡ Were groups similar at baseline?
â–¡ Was follow-up complete?
â–¡ Were patients/clinicians/assessors blinded?
â–¡ Were groups treated equally?
â–¡ Was there intention-to-treat analysis?
â–¡ Was the sample size adequate?
â–¡ Are results clinically significant (not just statistically)?
â–¡ Are results generalizable to target practice?
â–¡ Do the conclusions match the data?

## Limitations to Always Consider

- Open-label design: Risk of performance/detection bias
- Composite outcomes: Components may point in different directions
- Surrogate outcomes: May not translate to patient-centred outcomes
- Single-centre: Limits generalizability
- Industry funding: Potential conflicts of interest
- Early stopping: May overestimate benefit
- Post-hoc subgroups: Hypothesis-generating only
